# Todo List App

## Project Description
The project is a todo list app built using Nuxt.js 3, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to create, update, and delete todos. The app follows a full-stack architecture, with a server-side component handling HTTP requests and a client-side component for rendering the user interface.

## Learning Objectives
During the development of this project, I learned the following:

- How to create a full-stack web application using Nuxt.js 3.
- How to utilize TypeScript to add static typing and improve code maintainability.
- How to handle HTTP requests using event handlers on the server-side.
- How to define interfaces to create models and enforce a specific data structure.
- How to establish communication between the client-side and server-side components.
- How to update the user interface dynamically using the reactive paradigm.

By working on this project, I gained valuable experience in building a modern web application, integrating different technologies, and implementing essential features such as CRUD operations and real-time UI updates.
